        The Meetings
      </h2>
      <p>
        We haven't planned our first Meeting for Manchester yet, we're still <a href="#venues">working out</a> where we want to hold it! If you have any ideas, fork <a href="https://github.com/computeranonymous/computer">the repository</a> or send suggestions to me on
twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/sjmarshy">@sjmarshy</a>, whichever is easier.
      </p>

      <h2 id="venues">Potential Venues</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="http://thefontbar.wordpress.com/">The Font Bar</a> is super cheap, however it's small and noisy and gets pretty full, so it might not be ideal for a large group
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.screampubs.co.uk/thefootagemanchester">Footage</a> is larger than Font, but it can still be a little loud
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.manchesterbars.com/bayhorse.htm">The Bay Horse</a> is more central than the others, located in the northern quater. Nice atmosphere, too.
      </p>

      <p>
        We need a few more suggestions for venues really!
