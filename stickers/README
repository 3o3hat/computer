STICKER SOURCE FILES

These were hacked up by @tef, and includes three files:

* ComputerComputerComputer.png
  Originally printed on clear vinyl 6cm wide by 3cm high 

* computer-transparent.png, computer-black.png
  For one sticker, on black vinyl, 3cm by 3cm
  The transparent one was used, as diginate had an online editor, and it was easier

The logos were cobbled together, using the Glass TTY font, with a smidgen of bloom, and gaussian blur. 
More so on the logo sticker.
