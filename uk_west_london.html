3-7 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NY, on <b>Thursday 24th October 2013</b>, from about 18:30. 
<p>Copies of Amiga Power were read, space invaders and Pac-Man ghosts were cross-stitched, people attempted regular expression crosswords, and read print-outs of esoteric languages such as the My Little Pony inspired <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/FiM%2B%2B">FiM++</a>. 
Cider, lemonade and lime, beer, and other such beverages were drunk, pies were eaten. Stickers were stuck. (Thanks Tef!)
And also, most importantly, many wonderful conversations were had.
