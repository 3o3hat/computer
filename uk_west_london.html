<h1>Computer Anonymous â€” West London group</h1>

<p>Read <a href="index.html">The overview</a> if you haven't already, especially the code of conduct.</p>

<p>The oddly named West London group will meet at: <a href="http://www.madhatterhotel.co.uk">The Mad Hatter</a>, 
3-7 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NY, on <b>Wednesday 15th January</b>, from about 18:30.</p>
<br />
<p>Come to the pub, have a drink, and say "Computer". Meet other people who use computers, and talk about interesting things.

(You could also learn to cross-stitch a space invader, or read some copies of Amiga Power. Also, rather close to the pub is a building that is upside down! Look out for that.)</p>

<h2>Previous Meet-ups</h2>

<p>The West London group met on <b>18th December 2013</b> at <a href="http://www.therylston.com/">The Rylston</a> in Fulham, from 18:30.

The Rylston is a short walk from Fulham Broadway, West Brompton and West Kensington tube stations. 
      
The pub was quiet, despite a quiz happening. Pizzas were consumed, space invaders were cross-stitched, old computer magazines were read (including wonderful magazines from the 1980s! Thanks Tyrone!) and there were these stickers:</p>

Cider, lemonade and lime, beer, and other such beverages were drunk, pies were eaten. Stickers were stuck. (Thanks Tef!)
And also, most importantly, many wonderful conversations were had.
