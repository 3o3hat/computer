<p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.bishopsarms.com/Stockholm___Folkungagatan/Presentation">Bishop Folkis</a>. Quite roomy. Decent menu and good selection of beverages. Wednesdays might be a bad choice though due to #spelbar (conflicting intrests).<br />Quite a few busses stop nearby and short walk from Medborgarplatsen subway station.</li>
</ul>
