Computer.

Computer ?

Computer :-(

Now you understand, let's go to computer anonymous.

The Plan
--------

- We eat food
- We go to a good pub
- We say 'computer'
- We drink, be it beer, cocktails or soft drinks.

There isn't going to be regularly organized talks, workshops, or otherwise. 
It's just a chance to meet good people and talk about good and bad things. 
We will talk computer a lot, but we'd also like to not talk computer too. 

We might have a talk, we might try and learn a thing, but at the end of the day we're just here not to be alone when we find ourselves saying "computer".

Imposters Welcome
-----------------

This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.
If you're worried about not being computer enough, come. 
If your day job isn't code, come.
If you think you're an imposter, come. 
This isn't a group of experts, just people. 
We are interested in the social and technical problems.

The Rules
---------

- <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">A standard code of conduct applies</a> 
  This means: Don't harass people. Don't make exclusionary jokes. Don't even make them "ironically".
- This might be the group for you if you want to meet socially conscious nerds, to talk about interesting things
- This might not be the group for you if you enjoy hacker news, the daily mail, or think feminism 'has gone too far'.
- This is not an enterprenuerial meetup, nor is it networking. It is a support group.
- We're a very informal and ad-hoc group right now, so if you piss us off you won't be invited again. 
- Although we're meeting in a pub, there is no expectation of drinking alcohol. 
- The rules will become more explicit as we grow, and we're always trying to change for the better.
