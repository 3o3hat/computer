Computer.

Computer ?

Computer :-(

Now you understand, let's go to computer anonymous.

The plan
--------

- We eat food
- We go to a good pub
- We say 'computer'
- We drink

There isn't going to be organized talks, workshops, or otherwise. it's just a chance to meet good people and talk about good and bad things. we will talk computer a lot, but we'd also like to not talk computer too. 

We might have a talk, we might try and learn a thing, but at the end of the day we're just here not to be alone when we find ourselves saying "computer".

Imposters welcome
-----------------

This is a support group. no-one knows what they are doing.
If you're worried about not being computer enough, come. 
If your day job isn't code, come.
If you think you're an imposter, come. 
This isn't a group of experts, just people. 
We are interested in the social and technical problems.

The rules
---------

- <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">A standard code of conduct applies</a> 
- Don't come if you enjoy hacker news, the daily mail, or think feminism 'has gone too far'. this is not the group for you.
- This is not an enterprenuerial meetup, nor is it networking. it is a support group.
- We're a very informal and ad-hoc group right now, so if you piss us off you won't be invited again. 
- The rules will become more explicit if we grow.

The people
----------

@ntlk
@didlix
@tef
@tomstuart
@drmaciver
@samphippen
@mistertim
@alsothings

If you want to be invited, say hello to someone, and they will drag you along. 

The effort
----------

We are making plans on <a href="https://github.com/tef/computer">https://github.com/tef/computer</a>
