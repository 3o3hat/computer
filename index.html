Computer.

Computer ?

Computer :-(

Now you understand, let's go to computer anonymous.

The Plan
--------

This might be the group for you if you want to meet socially conscious nerds, to talk about interesting things: This is not an enterprenuerial meetup, nor is it networking. It is a support group.

- We eat food
- We go to a good pub.
- We say 'computer'
- We drink, be it beer, cocktails or soft drinks.

There isn't going to be regularly organized talks, workshops, or otherwise. 
It's just a chance to meet good people and talk about good and bad things. 
We will talk computer a lot, but we'd also like to not talk computer too. 

We might have a talk, we might try and learn a thing, but at the end of the day we're just here not to be alone when we find ourselves saying "computer".

Imposters Welcome
-----------------

This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.
If you're worried about not being computer enough, come. 
If your day job isn't code, come.
If you think you're an imposter, come. 
This isn't a group of experts, just people. 
We are interested in the social and technical problems.


The Rules
---------

<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">A standard code of conduct applies</a> â€” This means: Don't harass people. Don't make exclusionary jokes. Don't even make them "ironically".

- We want to be inclusive, but we don't welcome homophobic, racist, transphobic, or sexist behavior, amongst others.
- We think feminism is a good thing. We think brogramming is a bad thing.

- We're a very informal and ad-hoc group right now, so if you piss us off you won't be invited again. 
- Although we're meeting in a pub, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol. 
- The rules will become more explicit as we grow, and we're always trying to change for the better.

The people
----------

On IRC: irc.freenode.net ##computer

We are making plans on <a href="https://github.com/tef/computer">https://github.com/tef/computer</a>,
and if you have fixes or comments, open an issue! (p.s. Ask @tef to add you as a contributor)

The groups
----------

We have one group in <a href="uk_london.html">East London</a>, and we're working out the first date. 

If you'd like to start a group nearer you, fork the github repo and send us a pull request.
