<h1>Computer Anonymous â€” London group</h1>

<p>Read <a href="index.html">The overview</a> if you haven't already, especially the code of conduct.</p>
<br />
<p>Once upon a time, there were four London Computer Anonymous groups, the most active of which was <a href="http://computeranonymous.org/uk_east_london.html">East London</a>. 
<a href="http://computeranonymous.org/uk_west_london.html">West London</a> also met on occasion, but rarely actually in the west.
<a href="http://computeranonymous.org/uk_central_london.html">Central London</a> met once, but sadly, <a href="http://computeranonymous.org/uk_north_london.html">North London</a> still haven't.
<br />
<p>One day, these groups may become active again, but for now, the group formerly known as West London, is holding irregular meet ups, under the guise of Computer Anonymous - London.</a>
<p>
<p>Next event: Wednesday October 1st 2014, at the Willow Walk, 25 Wilton Road, SW1V 1LW, from 6pm. The pub is opposite Victoria Station.</p>
